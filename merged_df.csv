              Vacation Other Fringe Benefits (not indicated above): Brief description of the typical work day for an intern at this trainingÂ site Interns divide their time between clinical work, receiving and providing supervision, attending seminars, and administrative work. Clinical work includes therapy with individual clients, facilitation of groups, and on-call shifts during office hours (no after-hour on call is required). Up to eight hours per week are dedicated to training/clinical work focused on a specific population or clinical area of interest. Interview process description:Interview process description: Zoom or phone interviews will be conducted in late December and January. Applicants will be notified about their interview status via email on or before December 15. Interviews will generally include one senior staff member and one current doctoral psychology intern, and last about 50 minutes. Applicants also will schedule a follow-up 20 min Zoom interview with the Training Director. We plan to offer a virtual open house in January (date TBD). Although this open house is optional to attend, past applicants have stated that attendance has been very helpful in better understanding the culture and training of this site. Applicants are encouraged to attend for the full day of the open house if scheduling allows (i.e., it is not set-up as drop-in time, though we understand if scheduling conflicts prevent attendance). There are different scheduled presentations on that day so attending only part of the day will result in missing out on meeting some staff or receiving some information about the site.

The training of clinically-competent, ethical, self-aware, and culturally sensitive psychologists is central to our mission. The training program is based on a practitioner-scholar model, which values learning both from direct experience and the scientific literature. A developmental focus is reflected in graduated training experiences and expectations. As trainees gain experience, expectations for more advanced professional skills, greater self-awareness, and autonomous functioning increase. In addition to individual and group supervision, interns participate in seven seminars (Diversity, Group, Supervision of Supervision, Outreach, Assessment, Research, and Professional Issues). All interns receive a solid base of training in individual and group therapy, crisis intervention, supervision skills, assessment, outreach and prevention, and diversity issues. Opportunities exist for interns to individualize their training with rotations with one of our specialty counseling teams: 1) training focused on treatment related to the use/abuse of alcohol and other drugs (DAY Programs), 2) training with our DBT-informed post-hospitalization program (iTEAM), 3) IPV rotation, 4) eating disorders rotation. Alternatively, interns may elect to work with an individual staff member in one of several specific areas of interest and expertise (possible Special Interest Areas include assessment, work with specific student populations, group, and supervision). A fairly unique aspect of the internship is the close collaboration with medical, social work, and other professions afforded by this integrated site. Presenting issues of clients range from the expected developmental concerns of college-aged students to severe mental health diagnoses, including psychoses and personality disorders. Staff come from an array of theoretical orientations. Close working relationships have been developed with the various Student Diversity Programs and Services offices on campus, as well as with other university offices and departments. Please note that we will not be offering a Behavioral Health rotation during the 2025-2026 internship year.

Interns can expect to complete an 8-hour/week rotation with either our on-call counseling team or our i-TEAM (DBT-informed post-hospitalization program) in order to get some crisis training and experience in one semester. They also will spend two hours per week supervising a practicum student and two hours per week co-facilitating an interpersonal process group throughout both the fall and spring semesters. Interns can elect to participate in a group or supervision special interest area that would provide additional opportunities to gain experience with group facilitation or practicum student supervision. Interns also can elect to do an 8-hour/week rotation focused on treatment of substance use disorders, intimate partner violence, or eating disorders. Alternatively, students can complete a Special Interest Area with a clinical population of interest, increasing experience with certain populations. Please see our website for additional details.

CPS staff value diversity, equity, and inclusion and maintain a culturally humble stance. We continually endeavor to advance our awareness, knowledge, and skills to provide culturally attuned services that recognize and honor clientsâ unique intersecting identities. The internship affords interns with opportunities to refine therapy skills in a number of areas (individual, couples, group). Interns receive 2 hours of individual and 2 hours of group supervision each week and intensive, in-depth, and supportiveÂ supervision is provided to facilitate progression of clinical skills and professional development. Other components of the training program include: diversity and cultural focusÂ (e.g. in seminars, campus community outreach, and in work with clients who idenitify with range of intersecting identities), psychological assessment, outreach, consultation, multidisciplinary collaboration with other health care professionals, provision of supervision to master's level interns, crisis assessment and intervention, training in the implementation of telehealth services, and a variety of training seminars (e.g. diversity, supervision of supervision, assessment, training seminar). The internship allows for some flexibility to individualize the training year based on individual interests. All of this is done in a challenging, yet, highly supportive and relationally focusedÂ environment. The staff is deeply invested in interns' training and professional development, and values the interns' contribution to the Center. Former interns have consistently evaluated the program as being collegial, supportive, growth promoting, and transformative in the transition to becoming autonomous professionals.

We take a broad view of intern applicants' related experiences (e.g., services across treatment modalities and mental health-related community engagement) and will look forward to reading your cover letter describing your amazing accomplishments. This is consistent with the supportive, strengths-based approach to our training program. Program Description The UCC embraces a scientist-practitioner training philosophy to train Health Service Psychology interns in a comprehensive outpatient multidisciplinary agency; staff members include licensed psychologists, social workers, master's level mental health counselors (CMHC and LMFT), and psychiatric nurse practitioners. We provide preventive, developmental, and therapeutic services to a large and diverse university community. The agency has a strong and enduring commitment to diversity, inclusion, and anti-racism. We consistently strive to integrate multiculturalism into our everyday functioning. We advocate a philosophy of acceptance, compassion, and support for those we serve, as well as for each other. We have equally strong commitments to high-quality service delivery and to training. Specific opportunities include: Counseling with individuals, groups, and people in committed relationships; Intervening in mental health crises; Co-teaching an in-house undergraduate seminar to peer mentors; Providing clinical supervision to doctoral practicum trainees & undergraduate peer mentors; Facilitating workshops through the SWAMP (Skills Workshops and Mindfulness Programming); Conducting campus outreach/consultation; and Completing formal assessment batteries and test reports. Each intern completes an inclusion-focused, social-justice-oriented project called a Systems Intervention Project (SIP). Interns participate in intern training seminars in critical positionalities & diversity, group therapy, outreach & consultation, relationship therapy, applied ethics,Â  professional development, psychological assessment, evidence-based practice, professional licensing and standards, and clinical supervision. Research opportunities are available. Please see our website for a complete description of our training program: http://counselingcenter.utah.edu/ The UCC is committed to increasing awareness, knowledge, and advocacy about human diversity and culture so that meaningful, effective interconnections can lead to adaptive changes on individual and societal levels. We recognize that people do not live outside of cultural contexts, and we actively explore the impacts of systems of power and oppression in our understanding of mental health and mental health treatment. Our goal is for all eligible students, faculty, and staff to be able to access our services and feel accepted and understood regardless of culture, ethnicity, gender (including identity and expression), generation, lifestyle, religion/spirituality, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, size, national origin, language, or physical and mental functioning. As mental health professionals who adhere to the respective professional ethics and standards of the various mental-health disciplines represented at the UCC, we have a personal and professional responsibility to: Identify and understand our own attitudes, biases, assumptions, and values about human behavior; Recognize and demonstrate awareness of clients' world-views, including his/her/their attitudes, biases, assumptions, and values; Educate ourselves so that we can better understand the influence and impact of our culture within the counseling relationship; Provide multiculturally-oriented and effective counseling (e.g., appropriate help-giving practices, intervention strategies, and cultural structures) to all eligible students, faculty, and staff; and Promote the intellectual, emotional, social, psychological, and/or spiritual development of our clients and campus community. In order to meet this goal, we consistently strive to integrate multiculturalism into the everyday functioning and structure of our agency, including the organizational, administrative, training, service, and individual levels. While this integration of multiculturalism is reflected in the UCCâs policies, procedures, and programming, our mission to promote multiculturalism and eliminate prejudicial and discriminatory practices (APA, 2003) extends not only to ourselves, but also outside our agency to the campus and surrounding communities.Â  As detailed below, UCC has numerous campus and community diversity-related organizational partners and is an institutional member of the LGBTQ-Affirmative Therapist Guild of Utah .

The program combines (1) direct services such as clinical work, mental health promotion, and consultation, with (2) supervision and (3) didactic/experiential learning components such as seminars and/or in-service training. Our training model is developmental where learning experiences initially include more support and direction from licensed staff and move toward providing increased independence to our trainees. Our diverse, multi-disciplinary staff offers a variety of theoretical approaches but highlights personal strengths, mindfulness, relationship building, relational-cultural theory/therapy, diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice, the process of psychotherapy, and other evidence-based treatments. Interns are valued as important contributing members of the CAPS family, and we view the interaction between our system and the individual trainee as an important source of learning. One goal is to facilitate a process of integrating the personal self with the professional self. This includes factors such as knowing one's strengths and growth areas, maintaining an awareness of one's impact on clients and colleagues, developing/maintaining cultural humility, managing stress levels, setting realistic professional goals, and striving toward a healthy balance in one's life. Finally, we promote psychologists to become integrated members of the agencies and communities in which they serve, work, and live. Here at OSU, we work hard to ensure that CAPS is an active and visible presence on campus, and we work collaboratively with other departments. Interns will have opportunities to work and interact with staff, faculty, and students across the campus community.

Program Description The Texas State University internship program in Health Service PsychologyÂ is designed to prepare interns to function as generalist psychologists by providing them with broad skills that are applicable in a variety of outpatient settings. Training at the Texas State Counseling Center is based on the belief that a competent practitioner in the field of psychology should be guided by knowledge of clinical theory and applied research, awareness of ethical/legal/professional standards of practice, sensitivity to individual differences within a diverse society, and openness to lifelong learning. We incorporate this philosophy into our training program through the use of a practitioner-apprenticeship training model in which didactic and experiential learning are combined.The content and training methods of the Texas State internship program are determined by the following overarching goals: to provide training and opportunities for skill development in the areas of counseling/psychotherapy, crisis intervention,trauma, assessment, psychoeducational programming, consultation and supervision, to promote knowledge and understanding of the impact of cultural issues and individual differences in working with diverse clients and colleagues, to facilitate interns' professionalism and integration of ethical/legal/professional standards into all areas of practice, and to assist interns in the process of developing a professional identity as a psychologist.
